2. Innovation and Problem Solving:
   - Introduced an interactive approach using Cards Widget to gamify the TFE Onboarding process which involves adding different lanes and workspaces for a single TFE Environment.

3. Collaboration and Communication:
   - Collaborated seamlessly with cross-functional teams, including UI/UX designers, developers, fostering a positive working environment.
