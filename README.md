# Blob-Storage



# Solution
- This project has been built with respect to the essential requirements of a BLOB storage system.
- Mainly used Flask for app routes such as login,signup,upload etc.
- Used SQLITE3 database to store the credentials as well as the files uploaded by each user.
- Hashed each password entry through SHA256 encryption.
- Error Handling is also taken care of i.e user enters invalid username or password,etc.
- Handeled Session management for each user to reduce traffic.

# Features
- Login/Signup:User create an account on the application and logs into the application using  valid username and password.
- Files:User can now view all the files he has access to and has uploaded.
- Upload:User can upload ant format file onto the storage system.
- Share:User can share their files with any valid user of the application.
- View/Download:User can view or Download the files onto their local system.
- Rename:User can rename files according to their choice.
- Delete:User can delete files according to their choice.
- Logout:User can successfully logout and the changes will be preserved on the storage system.
